# NGINX ACL Architect Design Decisions

## File Paths and Container Configuration (2025-04-16)
- NGINX configuration file path is consistently set to '/opt/proxy/nginx.conf' across all components
- Both nginx-proxy and nginx-acl-architect containers need read-write (rw) access to nginx.conf
- Mount nginx.conf at the same path in both containers to maintain consistency
- Logs directory is mounted as read-only in the architect container but read-write in nginx container

## Server Configuration (2025-04-16)
- Express server handles both static file serving and API endpoints
- All non-API routes serve the SPA index.html
- API endpoints are prefixed with '/api/'
- Configuration changes are validated before being applied
- Backup is created before applying new configuration
- Failed configurations are automatically rolled back

## Security Measures (2025-04-16)
- NGINX configuration is tested before being applied
- Automatic rollback on failed configuration
- Backup creation before any configuration changes
- Configuration validation happens both client and server side

## UI/UX Decisions (2025-04-16)
- Settings page provides raw configuration editor with validation
- Toast notifications for all important actions and errors
- Help dialog explains configuration format and important notes
- Consistent use of shadcn/ui components
- All forms have validation before submission

## State Management (2025-04-16)
- Configuration state managed locally in components
- API calls for loading and saving configuration
- Toast notifications for operation feedback
- Error states handled with user-friendly messages

This file will be updated as new design decisions are made or existing ones are modified.
